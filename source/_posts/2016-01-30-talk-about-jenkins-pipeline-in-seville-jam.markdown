I was talking about [Jenkins Pipeline](https://github.com/jenkinsci/workflow-plugin#introduction) in the Seville JAM (Jenkins Area Meetup).
Thanks to everyone that attended the meeting and feel free to ping me in [twitter](https://twitter.com/amunizmartin) if want to ask something!
These are the slides.
