Hi! My name is Antonio Mu√±iz. 

I was born in Aroche in 1983, a little town in the south of Spain. After finishing high school I migrated to Seville where I started my Computer Science engineering studies.
On 2007 I got my first job and started my professional career around software development and engineering.

I'm currently working at [CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com) as a proud Jenkins developer.

In my earlier life I worked at klicap, where I enjoyed every day doing what I love to do: software. I gave my best in ClinkerHQ, OpinaHQ and mivecindad.
