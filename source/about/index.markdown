Mi name is Antonio Mu√±iz. I was born in Aroche in 1983, after finishing in high school I emigrated to Seville where I started my Computer Science engineering studies.
On 2007 I got my first paid job and started my professional career around software development and engineering.

I'm currently working at klicap, where I enjoy every day doing what I love to do: software. In the last years I've been giving my best in http://clinkerhq.com, http://opinahq.com and http://mivecindad.com.
